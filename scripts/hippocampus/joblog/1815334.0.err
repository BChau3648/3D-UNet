/opt/conda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pytorch3dunet-1.8.7-py3.11.egg/pytorch3dunet/unet3d/trainer.py:421: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`). Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.close()`.
